    Going over all cells, we can count only those that are the "first" cell of the battleship.
    First cell will be defined as the most top-left cell. We can check for first cells by only
    counting cells that do not have an 'X' to the left and do not have an 'X' above them.

* minfreq lower bound: updated
    (1) if a node move DQ1 to DQ2 which DQ1 is empty with min freq
    (2) new node is put and evicted a old node, minfreq = 0;
* hashmap<key, DQ> key is the frequency, DQ stores the node with given freq and sorted by recently used.
* hashmap<key, node> find the node based on the key
